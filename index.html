        Tehrann is the capital of Iran and Tehran Province. With a population of around 8.7 million in the city and 15
        million in the larger metropolitan area of Greater Tehran, Tehran is the most populous city in Iran and Western
        Asia, and has the second-largest metropolitan area in the Middle East, after Cairo). It is ranked 24th in the
        world
        by metropolitan area population. It is also known for its sprawling development and futuristic architecture,
        epitomized by the Milad Tower and the Fereshteh Pasargad Hotel, designed by Zaha Hadid.<br><br>
        In the Classical era, part of the territory of present-day Tehran was occupied by Rhages, a prominent Median
        city
        destroyed in the medieval Arab, Turkic, and Mongol invasions. Modern Ray is urban area absorbed into the
        metropolitan area of Greater Tehran.<br><br>
        Tehran was first chosen as the capital of Iran by <em>Agha Mohammad Khan</em> of the Qajar dynasty in 1786,
        because
        of its proximity to Iran's territories in the Caucasus, then separated from Iran in the Russo-Iranian Wars, to
        avoid
        the vying factions of the previously ruling Iranian dynasties. The capital has been moved several times
        throughout
        history, and Tehran is the 32nd national capital of Persia. Large-scale demolition and rebuilding began in the
        1920s, and Tehran has been a destination for mass migrations from all over Iran since the 20th century.<br><br>
        Tehran is home to many historical locations, including the royal complexes of:

    <ul>
        <li>Golestan</li>
        <li>Sa'dabad</li>
        <li>Niavaran</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        where the two last dynasties of the former Imperial State of Iran were seated.
        Tehran's most famous landmarks include the Azadi Tower, a memorial built under the reign of <em>Mohammad Reza
        Shah</em>
        of the
        Pahlavi dynasty in 1971 to mark the 2,500th anniversary of the founding of the Imperial State of Iran, and the
        Milad
        Tower, the world's sixth-tallest self-supporting tower, completed in 2007, and the Tabiat Bridge, completed in
        2014.<br><br>

        Tehran has an international airport (Imam Khomeini Airport), a domestic airport (Mehrabad Airport), a central
        railway
        station, a rapid transit system, Tehran Metro, a bus rapid transit system, trolleybuses, and a large network of
        highways.<br><br>
        Plans to relocate Iran's capital from Tehran to another area, due to air pollution and earthquakes, have so far
        not
        yet
        received approval. A 2016 survey of 230 cities by consultant Mercer ranked Tehran 203rd for quality of life.
        According
        to the Global Destinations Cities Index in 2016, Tehran is among the top ten fastest growing
        destinations.<br><br>
        The City Council declared October 6 Tehran Day in 2016, celebrating the day in 1907 when the city officially

        the
        capital of Iran.<br><br>
